# DevWorkflow-Framework

**A structured AI-assisted development workflow framework with specialized agent commands for enhanced code quality and project management**

## Description

The DevWorkflow-Framework is a comprehensive development workflow system that leverages specialized AI agents to streamline software development processes. It provides standardized instructions, templates, and reporting structures to ensure consistent, high-quality development practices across projects.

This framework implements a **role-based AI agent system** where you can use simple `@agent` commands to instantly switch your AI assistant into specialized roles - from code exploration and documentation to testing and troubleshooting. Each agent follows detailed instructions and promotes best practices for their specific domain.

## Key Features

- **🤖 Agent Command System** - Use `@docwriter`, `@explorer`, `@reviewer`, etc. to switch AI roles instantly
- **📋 Specialized AI Instructions** - Each agent has detailed, role-specific guidance and methodologies  
- **� Automated Report Generation** - Structured documentation and analysis outputs
- **🔄 Quality Assurance Workflow** - Built-in review and validation processes
- **� Portable Framework** - Easy integration into any project via git submodules

## Quick Start

### 30-Second Setup

```bash
# Add to any project
git submodule add https://github.com/sandeand001/DevWorkflow-Framework.git devworkflow
```

### Use Agent Commands

In your AI chat (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.):

```
# Initialize the system
"Please follow the agent system in devworkflow/AGENT_SYSTEM.md"

# Use specialized agents
@docwriter update the README with installation instructions
@explorer analyze this codebase architecture  
@reviewer check this code for security issues
@tester design comprehensive test coverage
@fixer debug this authentication error
@refactorer improve code structure and reduce debt
@troubleshooter investigate this performance problem
```

**Full Setup Guide**: [`QUICK_SETUP.md`](QUICK_SETUP.md)  
**Complete Documentation**: [`AGENT_SYSTEM.md`](AGENT_SYSTEM.md)
