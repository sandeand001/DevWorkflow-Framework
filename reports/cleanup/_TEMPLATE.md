- Cleaned up eslint rules for removed features
```

### 3. Test Suite Optimization
- [ ] **Redundant Tests**: X tests consolidated
- [ ] **Brittle Tests**: X tests improved or removed
- [ ] **Coverage Gaps**: X new tests added for uncovered areas

**Details:**
```
- Consolidated 15 duplicate API tests into parameterized test suite
- Removed 8 flaky integration tests, replaced with stable unit tests
- Added regression tests for 3 edge cases discovered during cleanup
```

### 4. Structure & Organization
- [ ] **Module Organization**: X modules reorganized
- [ ] **Import Simplification**: X import paths optimized
